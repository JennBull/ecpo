-   [XQuery IDs Reader: To test the XQuery code please install the application "Stylus Studio X16 XML Enterprise Suite" and then               download the the ECPO folder and place it in the hard drive: C.  Open the XQuery file via Stylus app and run it. All XML files' ID         will be called. In case of uploading a new XML file, the query code should be edited. The change should be by writing the following 2       lines of code after string():  
    
          , $nl,
          doc('file:///C:/ecpo-master/jingbao/1939/04/.xml')/fold/@xml:id/string()

    please write the name of the new xml file before the ".xml" in the previously mentioned link. 
    PS: In order to test the XQuery file it is very important to download the whole project and place it in C. Not inside any other folder       but in C.]
